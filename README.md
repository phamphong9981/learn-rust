Since the Solana codebase is in Rust, it's IMPORTANT to understand the language. Here are some learning references:

- [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/)
- [Start here](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/a-half-hour-to-learn-rust) if you want to learn just enough to read the code, or only have ~30 minutes. 
- [Programming Rust](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-rust/9781491927274/) is a well-written book, full of useful examples beyond the basic examples of The Book.
